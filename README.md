## Description

As the title suggests, this application implements a functioning version of the card game, *Spot It!* (or more commonly known as *Dobble* in Europe). In addition to playing the game, this application also supports deck creation and a leaderboard.

### The Game

When the user selects the "Play" button, they will be taken to a configuration screen. Here, the user can modify the deck in two ways; how many cards they want in the deck and the number of symbols on each card in the deck. Additionally, the user can also select between two game modes: Burndown (single player) and Versus (multiplayer against bots). Once all of the desired settings have been selected, the user can start the game.

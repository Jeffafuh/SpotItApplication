## Description

As the title suggests, this application implements a functioning version of the card game, *Spot It!* (or more commonly known as *Dobble* in Europe). In addition to playing the game, this application also supports deck creation and a leaderboard.

*Spot It!* is a card game with a deck that contains a myriad of symbols on each card such that each any two cards has one, and only one, symbol in common. To generate a *Spot It!* deck with *n* symbols on each card, a finite projective plane of order *n-1* must be constructed. More information on the mathematics for how *Spot It!* decks are generated (and initial inspiration for this project) can be found [here](https://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/blog/mathematics-toys-and-games/dobble/)

### The Game

When the user selects the "Play" button, they will be taken to a configuration screen. Here, the user can modify the deck in two ways; how many cards they want in the deck and the number of symbols on each card in the deck. Additionally, the user can also select between two game modes: Burndown (single player) and Versus (multiplayer against bots). Once all of the desired settings have been selected, the user can start the game.

#### Burndown

Try to burn through the deck as fast as you can!
